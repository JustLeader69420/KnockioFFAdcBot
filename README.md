KnockioFFA Discord Bot

This is a pretty simple Discord bot made using the discord.js docs.
It includes a few simple slash commands with embeds and logs the usage.

You can try it out @ the KnockioFFA plugin support server (https://discord.gg/HSZ9fABeUS) or just git clone it, run npm install and afaik, you should be set!
Also, don't forget to rename the config.json.example to config.json and input the right data.

Should have any problems, you can DM me on Discord, JustLeader#5532 or join my Discord server that can be found under the "My Main Discord server" button at my Discord servers page. (https://dc.jldr.ga/)
